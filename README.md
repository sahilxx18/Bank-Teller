# Bank-Teller
Overview
This project is a simulation of basic banking transactions, designed to replicate interactions between a bank teller and a customer. It allows users to manage their finances through a variety of operations, including checking account balances, making deposits, withdrawing funds, and transferring money between accounts. The project serves as a foundational exercise for learning Python concepts such as functions, control flow, and data manipulation.

Key Features
Account Management:

Simulates two types of accounts: checking and savings.
Starts with a default balance of zero for both accounts.
Balance Inquiry:

Allows users to check their current balance in either account.
Provides detailed account summaries and handles errors for invalid account types.
Deposits:

Enables users to deposit money into their checking or savings accounts.
Validates deposit amounts and ensures successful transactions.
Withdrawals:

Supports withdrawals from both checking and savings accounts.
Prevents overdrafts by ensuring withdrawals do not exceed the account balance.
Handles invalid withdrawal requests gracefully.
Transfers:

Facilitates fund transfers between checking and savings accounts.
Ensures sufficient funds are available before completing a transfer.
Provides meaningful error messages for invalid transfer requests.
Purpose
This project is designed as an educational tool for beginners learning Python programming. It demonstrates how to use functions, conditional statements, and basic logic to solve real-world problems. Additionally, it introduces users to concepts of financial operations and error handling.

Applications
The Bank Teller Simulation can be used as a stepping stone for more complex financial systems. It showcases foundational principles of account management, making it suitable for learning Python, finance-related programming, or creating small-scale banking applications.

This project is a great way to practice problem-solving, logical thinking, and Python programming, while also gaining an understanding of basic financial transactions.
